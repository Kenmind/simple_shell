# NAME
hsh - command-line interpreter (shell) for terminal imulators

# SYNOPSIS

**./hsh** [*ARGUMENTS*]\
**./hsh**

# DESCRIPTION

The **hsh** shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a command line user
 interface for Unix-like Operating Systems. This man page is not intended to be 
a tutorial or a complete specification of the shell.

## Overview

The shell is a command/programme that reads input from either a file or 
the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system. 
The shell implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro
 facility that provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, 
along with line editing capabilities and built in history. It incorporates 
many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative 
language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts). 
That is, command can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into 
a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

## Invocation

**./hsh** invokes the shell in interactive mode while
**./hsh** **[arguments]** invokes the shell in non-interactive mode
